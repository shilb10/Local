== CS 241 Autograder Note: ==
This autograder is a preliminary assessment of your program's correctness. Your
grade may change UP OR DOWN based on the CORRECTNESS OF YOUR PROGRAM. We make every effort to ensure
that our autograder is 'smart' enough to not count off for simple things like grammar but, in doing so,
we may inadvertently allow for incorrect code to be counted as correct. If we have to change our script
to better reflect the CORRECTNESS OF YOUR PROGRAM, we will run the script on EVERY PROGRAM and update
EVERY AUTOGRADER OUTPUT to ensure fairness to all students. Thanks for understanding! - CS 241 Staff

(Please note, this autograder does not reflect a late submission penalty. This will be applied on Compass.)
