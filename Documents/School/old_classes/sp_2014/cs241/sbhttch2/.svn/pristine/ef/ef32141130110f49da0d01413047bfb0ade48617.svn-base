    <h1>Discussion Section for October 17, 2013: Producer-Consumer problem using Semaphore!</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      
      The proposed problem is a classical producer-consumer scheme in
      which there is just 1 producer and one consumer manipulating the
      bytes in a shared circular buffer. In particular, the shared
      buffer will be a an array of chars in which the producer writes
      one byte at a time getting it from a default string.
      
      We are going to use sem_wait and sem_post as primitives to
      provide semaphore functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <p>
      What has to be done is:
      <ul>
	<li>Complete the initialization of the variables</li>
	<li>Implement the Producer</li>
	<li>Implement the Consumer</li>
      </ul>
      That's all. <!-- I stayed up all night, it's 9 am, I have class
      at 9:30 and 4 hours of discussion section in the afternoon from
      1 pm. I'm done. -->
    </p>

    <h2>Compile and Run</h2>

    To compile these programs, run:
    <blockquote>
        make clean<br />
        make
    </blockquote>

    To run your own implementation (ds7.c):
    <blockquote>
        ./prodcons
    </blockquote>
