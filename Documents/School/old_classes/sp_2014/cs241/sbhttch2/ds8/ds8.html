	<h1>Discussion Section for March 14, 2013: Dining Philosophers!</h1>
	<hr />

	<h2>In Discussion Section</h2>
	<p>
        In ds8, you will solve a dining philosopher problem. Basically, A fork is placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers. Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat when he has both his left and right forks.
	</p>
  <p>      
        In this miniMP, we are going to solve the problem with the following approach; A philosopher can only eat whenever both forks are available. There are three functions that you need to implement <tt>pickup</tt> and <tt>putdown</tt>.
	</p>

	<p>
	      To help you with this miniMP, there are a couple of structures that are provided. The first is the <tt>global_state</tt> variable in <tt>dphil.h</tt> which describes the number of philosophers, the state of each philosophers and also provide you with the necessary synchronization variables. You may also find the variable id in <tt>phil_t</tt> to be useful too.
	</p>

	<h2>Compiling and Running</h2>
	<p>To compile and run your shell, run the following commands from a Terminal on a Linux machine:</p>
	<blockquote>
	$ make<br />
    $ ./dphil num_philosopher<br/>
	</blockquote>
